These sections are abstracted and can be used in multiple themes. They should contain no theme specific classes, ie no .theme-prefix_example-class. To apply theme specific css to a global component, use the page class and css cascade. For example, .theme-prefix_body-class .project-prefix_example-class.

Components include static global elements like the footer and dynamic elements that are generated from a data file, such as a carousel. A section can contain a component or multiple components, but a component cannot contain a section.
